Its plans started in 2001 (!), and only almost twenty years later it\u2019s being released\u2026 in a streaming service. Several directors and writers passed through this project, but Kenneth Branagh, Conor McPherson, and Hamish McColl are the poor souls that decided to stick around. I\u2019m not going to extend this review more than what it needs to. This is one of the worst films Disney has ever released, live-action or animated!\r\n\r\nI have no knowledge of the source material, so I can\u2019t give my opinion about if it\u2019s loyal to it or not. However, I can write that it\u2019s a shocking, genuinely horrible adaptation of a book saga that I know holds an immense fandom. I\u2019m so baffled at how bad this is that I don\u2019t even know where to start. I absolutely despise criticizing young kids\u2019 performances, especially when it comes to debuts like Ferdia Shaw\u2019s. But, in this case, I can\u2019t avoid it. I feel extremely sorry for Shaw, but his performance is truly embarrassing, not only due to his emotionless, bland expressions, but also the cinematography and editing.\r\n\r\nShaw spends the whole movie simply reading his line, and waiting for someone else to feed him the next one. I hate to write this, but it\u2019s one of the worst debuts from a young actor I\u2019ve ever seen. Nevertheless, it\u2019s not all Shaw\u2019s fault. The script is atrocious in every level, and for some reason, Haris Zambarloukos (DP) and Matthew Tucker (editor) keep the camera on the kid for way too long. Throughout the whole runtime, Shaw finishes his line, and the camera stays on him for extra seconds, waiting for the late cut, while Shaw\u2019s flawed acting is vulnerable.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay and the lack of a coherent story are the worst aspects of all, though. As someone who had no idea about who Artemis Fowl was, how the worlds of humans and fairies worked, and what the rules of this fictional universe were, I ended the film confused and blown away by the messy structure. Josh Gad (Mulch Diggums) spends the entire movie narrating the events with the most awkward, growly voice, and Judi Dench (Commander Root) follows the same strategy. The amount of heavy-handed exposition brutely forced into these ninety-four minutes is absurd for a flick supposed to start a new film saga.\r\n\r\nEvery single line of dialogue resembles some sort of announcement like new information has been discovered, even when it\u2019s not. The narrative structure is chaotic and tries to compact so much world-building that it\u2019s impossible to care for a single storyline or character. For the first half of the movie, I had no clue what it was about. There\u2019s a massive MacGuffin at the center of everything, a villain (?) who the film tells nothing about, and so many subplots jumbled together in a desperate attempt at making the whole movie make sense.\r\n\r\nThe editing is choppy as hell, the action sequences are hilariously bad with surprisingly dated CGI, and even the score (which might be the only decent component of this whole thing) makes a few scenes even worse. There\u2019s also a side story featuring Lara McDonnell (Officer Short) that\u2019s also poorly explored, but it\u2019s far more captivating than anything remotely close to Artemis. The latter is such an uninteresting character, one who I didn\u2019t care for a single second. I honestly can\u2019t figure out how Disney was able to put this out.\r\n\r\nArtemis Fowl is one of the worst feature films Disney has ever created, without a single doubt. There\u2019s absolutely no redeeming quality about it. As much as it hurts me to write this, Ferdia Shaw delivers one of the worst young performances I\u2019ve ever witnessed, but the embarrassment is shared by everyone involved in this atrocious mess of a movie. It\u2019s genuinely baffling how bad it is. It holds an appalling screenplay, packed with annoyingly explicit exposition, ridiculous voice-over (sorry Josh Gad), and an excruciatingly massive amount of information that couldn\u2019t be fit in a three-hour runtime, let alone such a short one like this. No storyline is explored nor executed properly, no character is close to being remotely interesting, every action sequence is a visual disaster, and the attempts at comedy fall incredibly flat. Technically, it\u2019s as shameful as the rest: choppy editing, flawed cinematography, and surprisingly cheap VFX. The only minor positive might be Lara McDonnell, whose performance I think is pretty decent, but I cannot recommend this colossal misfire.\r\n\r\nRating: F","id":"5ee51e7497eab4001fe3f76f","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5ee51e7497eab4001fe3f76f"},{"author":"Gimly","content":"I think that maybe if I had never read any of the Artemis Fowl books, then I would merely hate this movie. But I have read them, and that makes it even worse.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple characters in this movie who are doing a bad Cookie Monster voice, and the character with the worst voice of them all (Josh Gagrid) is also the narrator somehow? A decision which was both 100% unnecessary and 1000% annoying. As I stated, I read the books, but I want to be clear that I don't believe this movie is just a bad adaptation of that series, it is, stand-alone, pure fucking nonsense. Nothing in this movie is good, obviously, but nothing in this movie is even... an event. There is no throughline or followable plot or engagement between the characters and the audience or each other. I loathed almost every single moment of _Artemis Fowl_ and I don't want to spend any more time talking about it.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:½ - So bad it\u2019s offensive. I may never fully recover._","id":"5eecd1829661fc00385ec18e","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5eecd1829661fc00385ec18e"},{"author":"Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots","content":"In today\u2019s lecture titled \u201cWhen Disney Films Go Wrong,\u201d I present \u201cArtemis Fowl,\u201d a wholly unredeemable mess of a movie from director Kenneth Branagh. The studio dumped this trash heap on Disney+, and even the home streaming platform is far more than it deserves. There\u2019s very little magic in this CGI-heavy family film, and it\u2019s more of a yawn-fest than the engrossing adventure it obviously aspired to be.\r\n\r\nBased on the first two books in author Eoin Colfer\u2019s wildly popular children\u2019s fantasy series, \u201cArtemis Fowl\u201d tells the ho-hum story of adolescent criminal genius Artemis (Ferdia Shaw), an annoying kid who captures vicious fairy Holly Short (Lara McDonnell) at her underground world in an attempt to harness the magical powers needed to rescue his dad (Colin Farrell). There isn\u2019t much more to the plot than this, and the whole thing reeks of a grossly subpar \u201cHarry Potter\u201d rip-off. Even the story\u2019s narrator, the oversized dwarf Mulch Diggums (Josh Gad), is a dead ringer for Hagrid.\r\n\r\nThe cast ranges from irritating and distracting (Shaw, McDonnell) to really talented actors who probably should\u2019ve known better than to accept their roles for a Disney payday (Farrell, Gad, Judi Dench).\r\n\r\nThe movie gets progressively worse as it sputters along and, just when you think the film can\u2019t sink any lower, a fabulously \u201cwtf?!?\u201d scene arrives where Diggums unhinges his jaw, scoops up dirt at a rapid pace, and poops it right on out of his rear end.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I\u2019d rather have watched that scene on a loop for the full 94 minutes rather than this substandard junk.","id":"5f4d277feec4f30036d41808","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5f4d277feec4f30036d41808"}]
